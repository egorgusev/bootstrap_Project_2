                  Alan Moore (born 18 November 1953) is an English writer known primarily for his work in comic books
                  including Watchmen, V for Vendetta, The Ballad of Halo Jones and From Hell. Regarded by some as the best graphic
                  novel writer in history, he is widely recognised among his peers and critics. He has occasionally used such
                  pseudonyms as Curt Vile, Jill de Ray, and Translucia Baboon; also, reprints of some of his work have been credited to
                  The Original Writer when Moore requested that his name be removed.

                  the Man Who Has Everything". He was an artist for 2000 AD, for which he contributed a large body of work from its first
                  issue in 1977.
